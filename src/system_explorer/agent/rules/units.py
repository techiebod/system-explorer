"""Unit opinions: systemd unit health and restart churn.

One evaluator for both consumers: collect() derives each row's severity from
these opinions over the ListUnits summary facts, get_object() reports them
over the full property set. The acquisition-cost exception documented in the
package docstring lives here: NRestarts is a per-unit typed GetAll, not a
ListUnits column, and fetching it for every unit would turn one bus call
into hundreds — so restart-churn is presence-driven and fires on detail
facts only. A flapping-but-currently-active service therefore shows a warn
opinion when opened but an ok row; that is a stated cost decision, not
drifted thresholds.
